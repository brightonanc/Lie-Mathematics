# Lie-Mathematics

This code was written primarily as a personal aid for coursework involving Lie mathematics. 
It also served to verify some mathematics and algorithms I had deduced relevant to Lie mathematics.
This code only really aids in the exponential/logarithmic mappings of Lie algebras to Lie groups 
and vice-versa, but does so thoroughly accounting for edge cases. The "lie.py" file, when run as 
main, will test the Lie mathematics reasonably thoroughly.
